# Latent Embedding Optimization for Few-shot Segmentation

This repository is the code base for the project titled Latent Embedding Optimization for Few-shot Segmentation. 
The project is undertaken by Gopika Sudhakaran, Temiloluwa Adeoti, Jennifer Deborah and Istiaque Mannafee. This project is based on the paper "Meta-Learning with Latent Embedding Optimization" by Rusu et. al. 

# Run Code base
- Create a python virtual environment and install Pytorch 1.5.1 following guidelines at https://pytorch.org/
- Default pytorch version uses gpu
- To Run the code from a jupyter notebook 
    - Install your virutal environment as an using `ipython kernel install --user --name=<kernel_name>`
