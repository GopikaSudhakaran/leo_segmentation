# Latent Embedding Optimization for Few-shot Segmentation

This project attempts to solve the few-shot Segmentation problem using Meta-Learning.
Inspired by the paper "Meta-Learning with Latent Embedding Optimization" by Rusu et. al., the goal is to translate the successes of Optimization-based
Meta-Learning for the few-shot classification problem to segmentation.

## Team members
The project is undertaken by Temiloluwa Adeoti, Gopika Sudhakaran, Istiaque Mannafee, Jennifer Deborah
